# Welcome to Ambra's Portfolio Repository 

![Portfolio Banner](portfolio_banner.png)

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, I've curated a collection of small projects that demonstrate my skills, creativity, and potential as a working professional. Each project showcases a unique aspect of my abilities and passion for Software development and engineering, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Low Level Programming.

## About Me

I'm a third year Computer Science undergraduate at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam with a deep curiosity for cutting-edge technologies and a drive to create meaningful solutions. My journey in the field of engineering and innovation has given me the tools to approach challenges with an out of the ordinary way of thinking and a commitment to continuous learning.

## Projects


### [Project 1 : INSYTZ]

- **Description:** INSYTZ was a start-up that was meant to help start-up founders get more in-depth information regarding their customer's preferences in order to achieve product-market-fit efficiently and in a faster time. The start-up was part of the Minor of Entrepreneurship programme from the University of Amsterdam (UvA).
- **Technologies:** Technologies used in this project include Python, Pytorch, OpenAI.
- **Project:** Link to the collab notebook.

 ### [Project 2: IJVM Emulator]

- **Description:** This project, undertaken during my final semester of the first year of my computer science degree, delves into the complexities of emulating the Improved Java Virtual Machine (IJVM). This project is an in-depth exploration of the IJVM's instruction set, stack-based architecture and memory management model.
- **Technologies:** C programming language, x86 Assembly, Memory Management
- **Challenges:** As a first-year endeavor, I grappled with mastering C syntax, deciphering bytecode and x86 assembly, managing dynamic memory, and embracing the intricacies of a stack-based architecture.
- **Ways of coping with them:**
- ðŸš€Understanding the way binaries work and how to parse them in useful blocks of data
- ðŸš€Using practical examples and logical analysis when working with dynamic memory (also being very careful where I allocate memory ðŸ˜„ )
- ðŸš€Thoroughly studying the multiple implementations of a stack and how its logic fundamentally sustains the entire project

 ## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Python, Javascript
- **Technologies:** Git, Tensorflow
- **Problem-Solving:** An in-depth study of every problem is the first mandatory step in my problem-solving mantra.
- **Project:**  Not available due to privacy concerns from my university's programme.
